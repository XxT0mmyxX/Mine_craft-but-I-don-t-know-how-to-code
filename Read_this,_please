# AstroCraft 
Okay, so, bear with me because I've never really done this sort of thing.Unless, of course, you count "Scratch" as an exception.
This is not exactly original, since the inspiration came from Lax1dude's 'Eaglercraft' (https://tinypixelcraft.styopa.repl.co/)
since 1) I'll be veiwing and modifying some of the code from that, and 2) If he decides he wants to help with this respiratory.
Anyways, I may start this out as the 1.5 version <may or may not just recreate his respiratory> but Update it while my skills improve.
-lets hope this chromebook doesnt turn into an airplane lol- 
Okay enough goofy ahh rambling.
I present to you....
*Boring but mandatory legal (?) stuff >:]*
